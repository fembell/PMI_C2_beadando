This is an inventory manager.


To choose a function, the user has to input a number associated with the desired function and then hit enter.

The user’s first option will be “List Items” which lists out all the products and their attributes that are currently stored in the application
(the list is empty by default and new items can be added with the second function). 
After the list has been shown, the user can continue by pressing any button (except ’m’) and then Enter, the main menu will be visible again or when ‘m’ is pressed followed by an Enter the user
will be able to modify items in the inventory by giving their name and then inputting the desired, new name and attributes.

The second option is called “Add new item”, when called, it will ask for an item’s name and some other attributes as well and they will be added to the inventory.

The third option removes items from the inventory by asking for their name from the user.

The read from and write to XML function does not work since I ran out of time before the deadline.
If the user tries to use said functions, they will be greeted with a “NON FUNCTIONAL” statement and asked to press Enter to continue back to the main menu.
If the language of the provided readme file is inconvenient, please ask the developer for providing it in another language as well.

Thank you for reading this little note.
